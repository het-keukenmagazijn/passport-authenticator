# Laravel Passport Authenticator
## Introduction
This package is a self-refreshing [Laravel Passport](https://laravel.com/docs/5.8/passport) authenticator. There are superclasses available with which you can make quick custom connectors for all your (micro)services and you will never have to worry about having to maintain, refresh or create your bearer tokens yourself.

The Laravel Passport Authenticator is still being tested but further instructions about the implementation and how to use the package properly will follow **soon**! 

# TEST PHASE
